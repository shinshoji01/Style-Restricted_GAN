## Installation of some apps

**Git LFS (large file storage)**

Since this repository contains the parameters of the models. I used Git LFS to store a large file. The codes below are the recipe for this.

```bash
brew update
brew install git-lfs
```
- then, navigate to this repository.
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs fetch --all
git lfs pull
```
